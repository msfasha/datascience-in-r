#### Practical Examples and Exercises

Certainly! Here is the documentation with the assumptions for each test included:

### 1. One-sample T-test

**Use:** To test if the mean of a single sample is significantly different from a known or hypothesized population mean.

**Assumptions:** - The sample data is normally distributed. - The sample observations are independent.

**Example:**- Suppose we want to test if the average satisfaction score of customers for a new product is significantly different from the target satisfaction score of 5.

**Code:**

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate customer satisfaction scores
satisfaction_scores <- rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 2)

# Perform one-sample t-test to test if the mean satisfaction score is significantly different from 5
t_test_result <- t.test(satisfaction_scores, mu = 5)

# Print the satisfaction scores
print(satisfaction_scores)

# Print the t-test result
print(t_test_result)
```

**Interpretation:**

**Satisfaction Scores:** Generated customer satisfaction scores with a mean of approximately 5.

-   **T-test Result:**

    -   **t:** Test statistic (-0.26299)

    -   **df:** Degrees of freedom (29)

    -   **p-value:** Probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true (0.7944)

    -   **95% Confidence Interval:** Range within which the true mean lies with 95% confidence (4.173147 to 5.638438)

    -   **Sample Mean (mean of x):** Average satisfaction score (4.905792)

**Conclusion:** Since the p-value (0.7944) is greater than the common significance level (0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

This indicates that the average satisfaction score is not significantly different from the target score of 5.

### 2. Two-sample T-test (Independent)

**Use:** To compare the means of two independent samples to see if they are significantly different.

**Assumptions:** - The samples are independent of each other. - The data in each sample is normally distributed. - The variances of the two populations are equal (if using the standard t-test, not Welch's).

Example:- Suppose we want to test if there is a significant difference in average performance scores between employees who received training and those who did not.

**Code:**

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate performance scores for two groups
trained_employees <- rnorm(30, mean = 75, sd = 10)  # Employees who received training
untrained_employees <- rnorm(30, mean = 70, sd = 10)  # Employees who did not receive training

# Perform two-sample t-test to compare the mean performance scores between trained and untrained employees
t_test_result <- t.test(trained_employees, untrained_employees)

# Print the performance scores
print(trained_employees)
print(untrained_employees)

# Print the t-test result
print(t_test_result)
```

**Interpretation:**

-   **Performance Scores:**

    -   **Trained Employees:** Generated performance scores with a mean of approximately 75.

    -   **Untrained Employees:** Generated performance scores with a mean of approximately 70.

-   **T-test Result:**

    -   **t:** Test statistic (1.672)

    -   **df:** Degrees of freedom (56.559)

    -   **p-value:** Probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true (0.248)

    -   **95% Confidence Interval:** Range within which the true mean difference lies with 95% confidence (-1.965426 to 7.456584)

    -   **Sample Means (mean of x, mean of y):** Average performance scores for trained employees (74.52896) and untrained employees (71.78338)

**Conclusion:** Since the p-value (0.1104) is greater than the common significance level (0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

This indicates that there is no significant difference in average performance scores between trained and untrained employees

Note: althought the averages are quite difference, yet, the t-test showed that there is not significant difference. Here is the interpretation for that:

The two-sample t-test takes into account not only the difference in means but also the variability within each group and the sample size. Here are some possible reasons why the t-test might not find a significant difference even if the means appear different:

1.  **Variability within Groups:** If the variability (standard deviation) within each group is high, it can obscure the difference between the group means.
2.  **Sample Size:** Smaller sample sizes result in less precise estimates of the mean, making it harder to detect a significant difference.
3.  **p-value and Significance Level:** The p-value might not be less than the significance level (usually 0.05), indicating that the observed difference could be due to random chance.

Let’s take a closer look at the standard deviations and sample sizes in your example. We will also plot the data to visualize the distributions.

### Revised Example: Two-sample T-test with Additional Insights

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate performance scores for two groups
trained_employees <- rnorm(30, mean = 75, sd = 10)  # Employees who received training
untrained_employees <- rnorm(30, mean = 70, sd = 10)  # Employees who did not receive training

# Print summary statistics
summary(trained_employees)
summary(untrained_employees)

# Calculate standard deviations
sd(trained_employees)
sd(untrained_employees)

# Perform two-sample t-test to compare the mean performance scores between trained and untrained employees
t_test_result <- t.test(trained_employees, untrained_employees)

# Print the t-test result
print(t_test_result)

# Plot the data
library(ggplot2)
data <- data.frame(
  score = c(trained_employees, untrained_employees),
  group = factor(rep(c("Trained", "Untrained"), each = 30))
)

ggplot(data, aes(x = group, y = score)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Performance Scores by Training Status", x = "Group", y = "Performance Score")
```

**Summary Statistics and Standard Deviations:**

```{r}
# Summary statistics
summary(trained_employees)
# Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
# 52.27   66.75   74.71   75.10   82.31   96.20 

summary(untrained_employees)
# Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
# 55.30   65.04   73.78   70.16   77.65   83.63 

# Standard deviations
sd(trained_employees)
# [1] 10.34925

sd(untrained_employees)
# [1] 9.403503
```

### Interpretation:

-   **Performance Scores:**
    -   **Trained Employees:** Mean = 75.10, SD = 10.35
    -   **Untrained Employees:** Mean = 70.16, SD = 9.40
-   **T-test Result:**
    -   **t:** Test statistic (1.6201)
    -   **df:** Degrees of freedom (57.635)
    -   **p-value:** Probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true (0.1104)
    -   **95% Confidence Interval:** Range within which the true mean difference lies with 95% confidence (-1.084326 to 9.984326)

**Conclusion:** Although the means appear different, the standard deviations are relatively high (10.35 and 9.40), which means there is substantial variability within each group. The p-value (0.1104) indicates that the observed difference could be due to random chance, and it is not statistically significant at the 0.05 level.

The boxplot visualization also helps to see the overlap in the distributions of the scores between the two groups, reinforcing the result that the difference is not statistically significant.

This revised example shows how variability and sample size can impact the results of a t-test, and why it's essential to consider these factors when interpreting the results.

### 3. Paired Sample T-test

**Use:** To compare the means of two related samples (e.g., before and after measurements on the same subjects).

**Assumptions:** - The differences between the paired observations are normally distributed. - The pairs are independent of each other.

**Example:**- Suppose we want to test if a training program has significantly improved employee productivity scores by comparing their productivity before and after the training.

**Code:**

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate productivity scores before and after the training
productivity_before <- rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 2)  # Productivity scores before training
productivity_after <- productivity_before + rnorm(30, mean = 0.5, sd = 1)  # Productivity scores after training

# Perform paired sample t-test to compare the mean productivity scores before and after training
t_test_result <- t.test(productivity_before, productivity_after, paired = TRUE)

# Print the productivity scores
print(productivity_before)
print(productivity_after)

# Print the t-test result
print(t_test_result)
```

**Interpretation:**

-   **Productivity Scores:**

    -   **Before Training:** Generated productivity scores with a mean of approximately 5.

    -   **After Training:** Generated productivity scores that are on average higher than before training.

-   **T-test Result:**

    -   **t:** Test statistic (-4.4489)

    -   **df:** Degrees of freedom (29)

    -   **p-value:** Probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true (0.0001169)

    -   **95% Confidence Interval:** Range within which the true mean difference lies with 95% confidence (-0.9901802 to -0.3664964=)

    -   **Mean of the Differences:** Average difference in productivity scores before and after training (-0.6783383)

**Conclusion:** Since the p-value (0.0001169) is less than the common significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis.

This indicates that there is a significant difference in productivity scores before and after the training, with productivity increasing after the training program.

### 4. One-way ANOVA

**Use:** To compare the means of three or more groups to see if at least one mean is different.

**Assumptions:** - The data in each group is normally distributed. - The variances of the populations are equal (homogeneity of variances). - The samples are independent.

**Example:**- Suppose we want to test if there is a significant difference in customer satisfaction scores among three different service plans (Basic, Standard, Premium).

**Code:**

```{r}
# Load necessary library
library(dplyr)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate satisfaction scores for three different service plans
basic_plan <- rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 2)  # Basic Plan
standard_plan <- rnorm(30, mean = 6, sd = 2)  # Standard Plan
premium_plan <- rnorm(30, mean = 7, sd = 2)  # Premium Plan

# Create a data frame
data <- data.frame(
  satisfaction = c(basic_plan, standard_plan, premium_plan),
  plan = factor(rep(c("Basic", "Standard", "Premium"), each = 30))
)

# Perform one-way ANOVA
anova_result <- aov(satisfaction ~ plan, data = data)
summary(anova_result)
```

**Interpretation:**

-   **Groups (Service Plans):**

    -   **Basic Plan:** Mean satisfaction score of 5

    -   **Standard Plan:** Mean satisfaction score of 6

    -   **Premium Plan:** Mean satisfaction score of 7

-   **ANOVA Summary:**

    -   **Df:** Degrees of freedom

    -   **Sum Sq:** Sum of squares

    -   **Mean Sq:** Mean squares

    -   **F value:** F statistic

    -   **Pr(\>F):** p-value for the F-test

**Conclusion:**

\- If the p-value is less than the significance level (e.g., 0.05), reject the null hypothesis.

Since the p-value (4.94e-5) is less than the common significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis.

This indicates that there is a significant difference in customer satisfaction scores among the three service plans.

### 5. Chi-square Test for Independence

**Use:** To test if there is a significant association between two categorical variables.

**Assumptions:** - The data is in the form of counts or frequencies. - The observations are independent. - The expected frequency in each cell of the contingency table is at least 5.

**Example:**- Suppose we want to test if there is a significant association between the type of marketing campaign (Email vs. Social Media) and customer response (Purchased vs. Not Purchased).

**Code:**

```{r}
# Load necessary library
library(dplyr)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Create a contingency table for marketing campaigns and customer response
# Rows: Customer Response (Purchased, Not Purchased)
# Columns: Marketing Campaign (Email, Social Media)
campaign_data <- matrix(c(20, 30, 50, 80), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
colnames(campaign_data) <- c("Email", "Social Media")
rownames(campaign_data) <- c("Purchased", "Not Purchased")

# Print the contingency table
print(campaign_data)

# Perform chi-squared test
chi_square_result <- chisq.test(campaign_data)

# Print the test result
print(chi_square_result)
```

**Interpretation:**

\- If the p-value is less than the significance level (e.g., 0.05), reject the null hypothesis.

Here, the p-value is 0.9849, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating no significant association between the groups and categories.

This indicates that there is no significant association between the type of marketing campaign (Email vs. Social Media) and customer response (Purchased vs. Not Purchased).

### 6. Mann-Whitney U Test (Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test)

**Use:** To compare the distributions of two independent samples when the assumptions for a t-test are not met.

**Assumptions:** - The samples are independent. - The data is ordinal or continuous. - The distributions of the two groups are similar in shape.

**Code:**

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate non-normally distributed sales performance scores for two sales teams using the exponential distribution
team_A_sales <- rexp(30, rate = 1/5)  # Sales performance scores for Team A
team_B_sales <- rexp(30, rate = 1/6)  # Sales performance scores for Team B

# Perform Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test to compare the sales performance scores between Team A and Team B
wilcox_test_result <- wilcox.test(team_A_sales, team_B_sales)

# Print the sales performance scores
print(team_A_sales)
print(team_B_sales)

# Print the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test result
print(wilcox_test_result)

```

**Interpretation:**

-   **Sales Performance Scores:**

    -   **Team A:** Generated sales performance scores using the exponential distribution with a rate of 1/5.

    -   **Team B:** Generated sales performance scores using the exponential distribution with a rate of 1/6.

-   **Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test Result:**

    -   **W:** Test statistic (308)

    -   **p-value:** Probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true (0.03577)

**Conclusion:** Since the p-value (0.03577) is less than the common significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis.

This indicates that there is a significant difference in the sales performance scores between Team A and Team B.

**Determine where is the difference?**

To determine which side the difference lies on, we can look at the medians of the two groups and the alternative hypothesis of the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test. Here’s how you can interpret the results and determine which group has higher values:

1.  **Check the Medians of Both Groups:** Calculate and compare the medians of the two groups.
2.  **Interpret the Alternative Hypothesis:** The alternative hypothesis of the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test is that the true location shift between the two groups is not equal to zero. If the p-value is significant and the median of one group is higher than the other, you can infer the direction of the difference.

### Example: Determining the Direction of the Difference

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate non-normally distributed sales performance scores for two sales teams using the exponential distribution
team_A_sales <- rexp(30, rate = 1/5)  # Sales performance scores for Team A
team_B_sales <- rexp(30, rate = 1/6)  # Sales performance scores for Team B

# Perform Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test to compare the sales performance scores between Team A and Team B
wilcox_test_result <- wilcox.test(team_A_sales, team_B_sales)

# Print the sales performance scores
print(team_A_sales)
print(team_B_sales)

# Print the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test result
print(wilcox_test_result)

# Calculate and print the medians of the two groups
median_A <- median(team_A_sales)
median_B <- median(team_B_sales)
print(paste("Median of Team A:", median_A))
print(paste("Median of Team B:", median_B))
```

### Interpretation:

-   **Medians:**
    -   **Median of Team A:** 3.60249855605114
    -   **Median of Team B:** 6.21641126927648
-   **Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test Result:**
    -   **W:** Test statistic (308)
    -   **p-value:** 0.03577
    -   **Alternative Hypothesis:** True location shift is not equal to 0

**Conclusion:** Since the p-value (0.03577) is less than the significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is a significant difference in the sales performance scores between Team A and Team B.

Comparing the medians, Team B has a higher median sales performance score (6.216) compared to Team A (3.60). Therefore, Team B performs significantly better than Team A.

This approach helps us determine not only whether there is a significant difference but also which group has higher values based on their medians.

### 7. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test

**Use:** To compare the distributions of two related samples when the assumptions for a paired t-test are not met.

**Assumptions:** - The differences between the paired observations are symmetrically distributed. - The pairs are independent.

**Example:**- Suppose we want to test if a new process has significantly improved employee productivity scores by comparing their productivity before and after the implementation of the new process using a non-parametric test (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test).

**Code:**

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate non-normally distributed productivity scores before and after the implementation of a new process using the exponential distribution
productivity_before <- rexp(30, rate = 1/5)  # Productivity scores before the new process
productivity_after <- productivity_before + rexp(30, rate = 1/6)  # Productivity scores after the new process

# Perform Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test to compare the productivity scores before and after the new process
wilcox_test_result <- wilcox.test(productivity_before, productivity_after, paired = TRUE)

# Print the productivity scores

```

**Interpretation:**

-   **Productivity Scores:**

    -   **Before the New Process:** Generated productivity scores using the exponential distribution with a rate of 1/5.

    -   **After the New Process:** Generated productivity scores using the exponential distribution with a rate of 1/6.

-   **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test Result:**

    -   **V:** Test statistic (74)

    -   **p-value:** 1.863e-09

    -   **Alternative Hypothesis:** True location shift is not equal to 0

-   **Medians:**

    -   **Median of Productivity Before:** 3.6

    -   **Median of Productivity After:** 8.4

**Conclusion:** Since the p-value (1.863e-09) is less than the common significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis.

This indicates that there is a significant difference in productivity scores before and after the implementation of the new process, with productivity increasing after the new process.

Comparing the medians, the productivity after the new process (3.6) is higher than before (8.4).

### 8. Kruskal-Wallis Test

**Use:** To compare the distributions of three or more independent groups when the assumptions for ANOVA are not met.

**Assumptions:**

\- The samples are independent.

\- The data is ordinal or continuous.

\- The distributions of the groups are similar in shape.

**Example:**- Suppose we want to test if there is a significant difference in customer satisfaction scores among three different service plans (Basic, Standard, and Premium) using a non-parametric test (Kruskal-Wallis Test).

**Code:**

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate customer satisfaction scores for three different service plans
basic_plan <- rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 2)     # Satisfaction scores for Basic Plan
standard_plan <- rnorm(30, mean = 6, sd = 2)  # Satisfaction scores for Standard Plan
premium_plan <- rnorm(30, mean = 7, sd = 2)   # Satisfaction scores for Premium Plan

# Create a data frame
data <- data.frame(
  satisfaction = c(basic_plan, standard_plan, premium_plan),
  plan = factor(rep(c("Basic", "Standard", "Premium"), each = 30))
)

# Perform Kruskal-Wallis Test to compare the satisfaction scores among the three service plans
kruskal_test_result <- kruskal.test(satisfaction ~ plan, data = data)

# Print the satisfaction scores
print(data)

# Print the Kruskal-Wallis Test result
print(kruskal_test_result)

# Calculate and print the medians of the three groups
median_basic <- median(basic_plan)
median_standard <- median(standard_plan)
median_premium <- median(premium_plan)
print(paste("Median of Basic Plan:", median_basic))
print(paste("Median of Standard Plan:", median_standard))
print(paste("Median of Premium Plan:", median_premium))

```

**Interpretation:**

-   **Customer Satisfaction Scores:**

    -   **Basic Plan:** Generated satisfaction scores with a mean of approximately 5.

    -   **Standard Plan:** Generated satisfaction scores with a mean of approximately 6.

    -   **Premium Plan:** Generated satisfaction scores with a mean of approximately 7.

-   **Kruskal-Wallis Test Result:**

    -   **Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared:** 17.693

    -   **Degrees of Freedom (df):** 2

    -   **p-value:** 0.0001439

-   **Medians:**

    -   **Median of Basic Plan:** 4.85

    -   **Median of Standard Plan:** 6.09

    -   **Median of Premium Plan:** 7.05

**Conclusion:** Since the p-value (0.0001439) is less than the common significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis.

This indicates that there is a significant difference in customer satisfaction scores among the three service plans.

Comparing the medians, the Premium Plan has the highest median satisfaction score (7.05), followed by the Standard Plan (6.09), and then the Basic Plan (4.85).
